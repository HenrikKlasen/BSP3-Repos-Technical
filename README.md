## Goal
The goal is to get a running solar system simulation with fixed-orbit celestial bodies, and vector calculated gravitational pull for satellites (as well as a thrust vector system)

## General
This is part of a Bachelor Semester project, for which there will also be a report with scientific results. It will come in a different Repository, for separating LaTeX files from unity project files
